# Bad-BugCheck-
Bad Apple but its BSOD [Bootvid]

# How does it work???
The driver uses bootvid's ```VidBitBlt``` function to display each frame and in the end it BugChecks. Bootvid is also used by the BSOD for displaying on the screen.
However as it was only made for displaying the BSOD, Bootscreen it flickers alot and is very slow while displaying the bmps quickly
